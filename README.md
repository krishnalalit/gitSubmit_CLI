# GitSubmit Command Line Interface #

### Outline ###

This project is a part of the GitSubmit suite which helps users on Linux/Unix based operating systems to download their repositories and work on them, through the terminal. The core functionality of this application is to lessen the load on users and download the repository onto their systems without them having to give commands on the terminal.

### Application Dependencies ###

This application uses Python framework and its dependencies to function.

[Python Environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/) can be set up on windows by following the link. An executable file gets downloaded and a **Python IDLE** is setup on the system which is a python shell.

This [link](https://bitbucket.org/gitsubmitsuite/gitsubmit_cli/wiki/Home) describes in great detail on setting up python environment.

It also uses [pip](https://packaging.python.org/install_requirements_linux/) as another dependency for installation of other dependencies.

It also uses [Python Wrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-gitlab) for GitLab API to provide interaction with the GitLab server of our organization.
Refer (GCLI#006 under issues section)


It uses [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Installing-Bash.html) built into the Linux system by default.
